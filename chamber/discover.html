          One of the most famous temples in Andhra Pradesh, Iskcon Temple is a
          recreational centre in Rajahmundry. It is known as the second-largest
          Iskcon Temple in the Southern region of India after the Iskcon in
          Bangalore. Also known as Gowthami Ghat, this temple is a popular
          worship spot and is definitely worth a visit. Built across 2 acres of
          land on the banks of the Godavari River, this temple was created by
          the Iskcon group which stands for International Society for Krishna
          Consciousness and is a temple primarily dedicated to Lord Krishna.
          Many Rishis are believed to have performed Tapasya or prayer here and
          has a few alternative names such as Sri Gopinath Temple and Ramananda
          Raya Gaudiya Math since it is believed that Sri Chaitanya and
          Ramananda Raya exchanged words on this site. It is one of the most
          modern temples with a number of facilities available for tourists and
          should be on the list for those who wish to see Hindu culture in South
          India.
