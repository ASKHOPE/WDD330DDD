          <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
          <p class="web-title">Shopify</p>

          <p>
            Shopify has caught my eye as I was looking for something for my
            personal project and I was able to notice the hierarchy between the
            lines of text and it was easy to focus on the main content which
            describes which is oversimplified into just one sentence and then
            followed by a little smaller sentence talking about the trust which
            people had on their site about their services and signup for trail
            and then we can notice the third sentence of text about the
            agreement for marketing emails from Shopify. The hierarchy here went
            from big to small in these three sentences.

          <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
          <p class="web-title">Kaspersky</p>
          <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.in">www.kaspersky.co.in</a>

          <img

          />
          <p>
            Kaspersky is another site where I was led by accident in the mobile
            browser as a popup then I realized the use of white space and clean
            design they had in their website with very good readability and very
            focused on what they provide as a service and an action button to
            view their products right after a short description about the safety
            they provide online. the padding used in the action buttons is
            centered and the overall website has the content aligned to the
            center. The center-aligned website gives the site a very clean look
            and better use of white space.

          <h3>PARC: Contrast</h3>
          <p class="web-title">Godaddy</p>
          <a href="https://in.godaddy.com">www.in.godaddy.com</a>
          <img
            src="images/godaddy_contrast.png"
            alt="Godaddy screenshot mobile view"
          />
          <p>
            GoDaddy is a very popular site to buy domains or other internet
            hosting services they provide, and their mobile site was very
            simple, and the contrasts caught my attention and they did a really
            good job with the different colors and the readability. the site
            kept it simple with the background they went black and white with
            the text and background throughout the site which gave it a more
            premium look and their font selection was simple as well. This made
            the content look rich and pleasing to the eye with the blend of
            colors theyâ€™ve added to highlight services in their site.
